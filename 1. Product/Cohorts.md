**Cohorts** are groups of users (or customers) who share a common characteristic or experience within a defined timeframe. Analyzing cohorts helps businesses track behavior, measure retention, and identify trends over time. Here’s how they work and why they’re valuable:

### **What Is a Cohort?**
A cohort is a segment of users grouped by:
- **Time-based actions**: Users who signed up in the same month (e.g., "January 2025 cohort").
- **Behavioral traits**: Users who completed a specific action (e.g., "first-time buyers").
- **Demographics**: Users in the same age group or location.

### **Types of Cohort Analysis**
1. **Acquisition Cohorts**: Track users acquired during the same period (e.g., marketing campaign).
2. **Behavioral Cohorts**: Group users by actions (e.g., feature usage, purchase frequency).
3. **Retention Cohorts**: Measure how many users return over time (e.g., 30-day retention).

### **Why Cohort Analysis Matters**
- **Spot trends**: Identify if newer cohorts perform better/worse than older ones.
- **Improve retention**: Pinpoint when users churn (e.g., after 2 weeks).
- **Optimize marketing**: Compare ROI across acquisition channels.

### **Example: Retention Cohort Table**


| Signup Month | Month 1 | Month 2 | Month 3 |
|--------------|---------|---------|---------|
| Jan 2025      | 60%     | 40%     | 30%     |
| Feb 2025      | 65%     | 45%     | 35%     |

*Insight*: February’s cohort retained better—what changed?

### **How to Use Cohorts**
1. **Define the cohort** (e.g., "users who installed the app in March").
2. **Track metrics** (e.g., revenue per user, session frequency).
3. **Compare cohorts** to spot patterns or outliers.

**Question for you, Balu PG**:
Are you analyzing cohorts for a specific goal (e.g., improving retention, measuring campaign success)? Or would you like help setting up a cohort analysis framework for your business? For example, are you tracking app users, e-commerce customers, or SaaS subscribers?
