## What would be most helpful for you?

I could create:
- A research planning template or framework
- Interview or survey question guides
- A synthesis framework for combining qual + quant data
- Best practices for stakeholder collaboration
- An insight report template

Or if you'd like to discuss strategy, challenges, or approaches for any of these research methods, I'm happy to dive deeper into those conversations.
