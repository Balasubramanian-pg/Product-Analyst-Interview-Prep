# Product-Analyst-Interview-Prep
Think of prep in four buckets:

**1. Core analytics skills**

* SQL: joins, window functions, CTEs, performance tuning.
* Product analytics concepts: funnels, cohorts, retention curves, feature adoption.
* A/B testing: hypothesis framing, sample size, significance, variance, post-mortems.
* Basic stats: confidence intervals, p-values, power, regression-lite thinking.

**2. Tools & hands-on**

* Product analytics: GA4, Mixpanel, or Amplitude.
* Visualization: Power BI/Tableau/Looker.
* Comfort with Sheets/Excel for quick models.
* (Bonus) Python/R for analysis automation.

**3. Research chops**

* Surveys: how to design unbiased questions, analyze NPS drivers.
* Interviews: JTBD framing, thematic synthesis.
* Usability testing basics.

**4. Business + storytelling**

* Turning data into exec-ready narratives.
* Linking metrics to acquisition, activation, retention, revenue.
* Root cause analysis with “so what” and ROI sizing.
* Market/competitor scan frameworks.

If you nail these, you cover 80% of what they’ll test. Want me to sketch a 30–60–90 day prep roadmap for you?
